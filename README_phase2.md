# Phase 2 Update - Complete Drop

This file set is a full, working implementation aimed at BGA Studio.
Copy `src/` into your Studio project directory `bgacats/` and import `dbmodel.sql`.

- Server - `bgacats.game.php` with rule helpers.
- Client - JS, CSS, view and template.
- States, stats, material, gameinfos - all included.
- Design addendum explains the Laser Pointer intercept buff chosen.

If anything breaks, check PHP logs - most actions throw clear exceptions.
