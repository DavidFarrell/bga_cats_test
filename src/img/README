This directory contains all graphic files for your game:
 - jpg and png formats are recommended, gif is also accepted
 - do not use subdirectories
 - use the "CSS sprite" technique for faster loading
 - use a reasonable resolution for the web and compression

Typically, this directory should contain fewer than 10 files, with no file larger than 4 Mb.

See: http://en.doc.boardgamearena.com/Game_art:_img_directory for more details.

## Herding Cats Assets

The herding_cats_art subdirectory contains card artwork:
- Card back: cardback.jpeg (72x96px)
- 6 card types: kitten.png, showcat.png, alleycat.png, catnip.png, animalcontrol.png, laserpointer.png (72x96px each)
- Total: 7 image files for the complete game

Note: BGA typically requires flattening subdirectories, so these files should be moved to the main img/ directory for production deployment.
