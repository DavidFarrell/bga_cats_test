 * _ pass that information to the appropriate template and show it to the user
 *
 * The global variable g_user and the method getCurrentPlayerId() are available.
 *
 * It will be called each time your game interface is displayed to a player, ie:
 * _ when the game starts
 * _ when a player refreshes the game page (F5)
