# Herding Cats – Player Cheat Sheet

## Card Reference
- **Kitten** (2 pts)  
  Play with no target. If unchallenged/truthful, add it face-down to your herd. Boosts Show Cats at scoring.

- **Show Cat** (5 pts, or 7 pts if you have any Kitten at scoring)  
  Non-targeting play; simply joins your herd when the declaration stands.

- **Alley Cat** (1 pt)  
  Target an opponent’s hand. Choose a slot:  
  – If it’s an Alley Cat, nothing happens and your played card is discarded.  
  – Otherwise they discard that card; your Alley Cat joins your herd.  
  Laser Pointer from hand can intercept and be challenged.

- **Catnip** (1 pt)  
  Target an opponent’s hand. Choose a slot:  
  – If it’s Catnip, it returns to their hand and your Catnip is discarded.  
  – Otherwise you steal that card face-down into your herd; you also add your Catnip.  
  Laser Pointer from their hand can intercept and can itself be challenged.

- **Animal Control** (0 pts)  
  Target an opponent’s face-down herd card. Reveal it:  
  – If it’s Animal Control, it flips face-up (now protected) and your card is discarded.  
  – Otherwise, discard the revealed card and add your Animal Control to your herd.  
  Laser Pointer from their herd can intercept; the pointer is sacrificed if truthful.

- **Laser Pointer** (0 pts)  
  Non-targeting play; adds to your herd. Later, defend by discarding a Laser Pointer from the relevant zone (hand vs. herd) to substitute for a targeted card. The intercept declaration may be challenged.

## Quick Flow Reminders
- **Declaration → Challenge → Resolution**: every play may be challenged; first challenger only. Truthful declarations resolve effects and add the played card to your herd unless the effect fizzles.
- **Ineffective vs. Same Type**: Alley Cat, Catnip, and Animal Control all fail when hitting their own type; your played card is discarded instead of scoring.
- **Laser Pointer Substitution**: a successful intercept swaps in the pointer, protecting the originally targeted card; the attacker’s card still enters their herd.
- **Face-Up Herd Protection**: face-up cards cannot be targeted by Animal Control or Catnip, but you can still discard a face-up Laser Pointer to intercept.

## Table Tips
- Keep a Laser Pointer accessible; it blunts the strongest targeted effects.  
- Diving on every declaration is risky—failed challenges cost a blind card from your hand.  
- Herd composition matters at scoring: sneak in a Kitten early so Show Cats hit 7 points.  
- Watch discard piles to track which threats (Laser Pointers, Catnip) are still live.
