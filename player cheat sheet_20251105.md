## Turn Overview
- **Play a card**
  - Choose any card from your hand, place it face-down, and declare its identity.
  - If the declared effect targets, you must name the target opponent as part of your declaration.
- **Challenge window**
  - Other players may announce a challenge; only the first challenger participates.
- **Target selection and intercept**
  - If targeting, pick the specific target (hand slot or herd card). Defenders may declare a Laser Pointer intercept (which may itself be challenged) before the reveal.
- **Reveal and resolve**
  - If challenged, resolve the challenge first. Then apply the declared effect, handling interceptions or ineffective outcomes.
- **Add to herd**
  - If the play stands and wasn’t thwarted, the played card joins your herd face-down as the declared identity.
  - The card is discarded instead if your declaration was successfully challenged or if the effect was ineffective-against-itself.

## Quick Flow Reminders
- **Declaration → Challenge → Resolution**
  - Every play may be challenged; only the first challenger participates.
  - Truthful declarations resolve effects and add the played card to your herd unless the effect fizzles.
- **Ineffective vs. Same Type**
  - Alley Cat, Catnip, and Animal Control all fail when hitting their own type.
  - Your played card is discarded instead of scoring in that case.
- **Laser Pointer Substitution**
  - A successful intercept swaps in the pointer, protecting the originally targeted card.
  - The attacker’s card still enters their herd.
- **Face-Up Herd Protection**
  - Face-up cards cannot be targeted by Animal Control or Catnip.
  - You can still discard a face-up Laser Pointer to intercept.

## Table Tips
- Keep a Laser Pointer accessible; it blunts the strongest targeted effects.  
- Diving on every declaration is risky—failed challenges cost a blind card from your hand.  
- Herd composition matters at scoring: sneak in a Kitten early so Show Cats hit 7 points.  
- Watch discard piles to track which threats (Laser Pointers, Catnip) are still live.

## FAQ
- **What can Animal Control target?**
  - Only face-down herd cards.
  - If the revealed card is Animal Control, it flips face-up and your played Animal Control is discarded.
- **How does Catnip resolve?**
  - You pick a specific card from the opponent’s hand.
  - You alone see what you stole; if it was Catnip, the attempt fails and your Catnip is discarded.
- **How do I declare a Laser Pointer intercept?**
  - Announce the intercept before the targeted card is revealed.
  - This announcement creates its own challenge window; resolve it before continuing.
- **How do I use a Laser Pointer to intercept an attack?**
  - From your hand you can intercept Alley Cat or Catnip.
  - From your herd you can intercept Animal Control.
  - The original target stays put while the pointer handles the effect.
- **What happens to the Laser Pointer after a successful intercept?**
  - Alley Cat discards the defender’s hand pointer.
  - Catnip steals that pointer into the attacker’s herd.
  - Animal Control discards the herd pointer face-up.
- **Can Laser Pointer intercepts be challenged?**
  - Yes. If you truly have the pointer in the claimed zone, the challenger loses a random card.
  - If you bluffed, you discard the presented card and the original attack continues.
- **How much is Show Cat worth?**
  - It scores 5 points.
  - It scores 7 if you finish with at least one Kitten in your herd.
