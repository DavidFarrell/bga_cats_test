# Herding Cats Card Errata

- **Kitten** – Rules match: worth 2 points, no targeting, joins your herd on a truthful resolution.
- **Animal Control** – Only targets face-down herd cards. If the revealed card is Animal Control, it flips face-up and your played card is discarded. Defenders can intercept with Laser Pointer, and the usual challenge window applies.
- **Catnip** – Attacker chooses a specific hand slot (not random). On success, the attacker alone learns the card’s identity. If the selected card is Catnip, the steal is ineffective and your Catnip is discarded. Laser Pointer interceptions follow the standard substitution/challenge rules.
- **Laser Pointer** – Besides being worth 0 and joining your herd, it can intercept Alley Cat/Catnip from hand and Animal Control from herd; the intercept declaration itself may be challenged. Current code still discards or transfers the Laser Pointer on a truthful intercept despite the addendum mentioning a tempo buff.
- **Show Cat** – Worth 5, or 7 if you end the game with at least one Kitten in your herd; otherwise behaves as a non-targeting card that simply joins your herd.
