## 🎮 How to Deploy to BGA Studio

### Step 1: Upload Files
1. Connect to your BGA Studio account via SFTP
2. Upload all files from `/workspace/projects/bga_cats_test/src/` to your game folder
3. Ensure the directory structure is maintained:
   ```
   your_game_folder/
   ├── dbmodel.sql
   ├── gameinfos.inc.php
   ├── material.inc.php
   ├── states.inc.php
   ├── stats.json
   ├── gameoptions.json
   ├── gamepreferences.json
   ├── herdingcats.game.php
   ├── herdingcats.action.php
   ├── herdingcats.view.php
   ├── herdingcats_herdingcats.tpl
   ├── herdingcats.css
   ├── herdingcats.js
   └── img/
       └── herding_cats_art/
           ├── cardback.jpeg
           ├── kitten.png
           ├── showcat.png
           ├── alleycat.png
           ├── catnip.png
           ├── animalcontrol.png
           └── laserpointer.png
   ```

### Step 2: Add Card Artwork
Place the card images in `img/herding_cats_art/`:
- You already have placeholder images from the implementation
- Replace with actual artwork when available
- Keep the same filenames for compatibility

### Step 3: Database Setup
1. Go to BGA Studio control panel
2. Click "Reload database structure"
3. This will create the tables from dbmodel.sql

### Step 4: Create Test Table
1. In BGA Studio, click "Create a table"
2. Select 2-6 players (recommended: start with 3)
3. Launch the game!

## 🐛 Known Limitations

These are NOT bugs, just features we didn't implement:
- No AI players (human-only for now)
- Basic animations (functional, not fancy)
- No sound effects (can add later)
- No tutorial mode (players learn by playing)

---

## 📝 Testing Notes

### What to Test First:
1. **3-player game** - easiest to manage
2. **Basic turn flow** - no challenges first
3. **Add challenges** - test bluff/truth outcomes
4. **Test each card type** - verify effects
5. **Test special rules** - ineffective-against-itself
6. **End game** - scoring calculation

### If Something Doesn't Work:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check BGA Studio logs for PHP errors
3. Verify all files uploaded correctly
4. Try refreshing the page (F5)
5. Check that card images are in place

## 🎉 What's Next?

### After Successful Testing:
1. **Polish** - Add any missing UI feedback
2. **Balance** - Adjust card distributions if needed
3. **Artwork** - Replace placeholder images
4. **Alpha Testing** - Invite friends to test
5. **Beta Testing** - Open to BGA community
6. **Publication** - Submit to BGA for review

### Optional Enhancements:
